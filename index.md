## 👨‍💻 Profile Summary

I am an **HPC & Linux Systems Engineer** with **2 years of hands-on experience** supporting **multi-petaflop high-performance computing environments** for **government and research workloads**. I was a **core contributor to India’s 11-Petaflops supercomputing infrastructure**, working on large-scale clusters consisting of **1,200+ compute nodes and NVIDIA H100 GPU accelerators**.

My work includes **HPC cluster deployment, GPU-accelerated workloads, and high-speed InfiniBand (400 Gb/s) networking**, along with enterprise Linux system administration. I work extensively with **NVIDIA Bright Cluster Manager, PBS Pro, and Slurm, DELL OME** to manage cluster provisioning, scheduling, monitoring, and health checks.


As part of **24×7 L2 operations**, I handle **incident management, root-cause analysis, system troubleshooting, and hardware integration**, including BIOS, firmware, and driver updates on **Dell PowerEdge servers**. Through **shell scripting and automation**, I have improved deployment efficiency, reduced repetitive administrative tasks, and lowered user-related support issues.

I am focused on building **scalable, reliable, and high-availability HPC environments** that enable scientists and engineers to run demanding workloads efficiently and consistently.
